A desktop agent for monitoring and optional control of a machine with real-time video streaming and automatic updates.

## Features
# Riko Agent

A lightweight desktop agent for monitoring and (optionally) controlling a machine.

Features

- Real-time screenshot capture
- MJPEG streaming for live viewing
- Optional action execution (mouse/keyboard/scroll) ‚Äî use only in trusted environments
- Automatic updates with an optional manual trigger
- Token-based authentication and audit logging

Quick start

1. Copy the `agent_setup/` folder to the machine you want to monitor.
2. (Optional) Set an environment variable: `AGENT_API_TOKEN` (if you need compatibility with older deployments, `REMOTE_API_TOKEN` is also accepted).
3. Run the installer or the agent script directly, for example:

```powershell
agent_setup\install_agent.bat
# or
python agent_setup\vm_agent.py
```

From the viewer machine:

```powershell
$env:VM_AGENT_URL = 'http://AGENT_IP:8000'
# Optional token
$env:AGENT_API_TOKEN = 'your-token'
python vm_stream_viewer.py
```

## Web Orchestrator (NEW)

For managing multiple agents with a modern web interface:

```powershell
# Install web dependencies
.\install_orchestrator.bat

# Start the web orchestrator
python orchestrator_web.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` for the web dashboard.

Features:
- Multi-agent dashboard with live screenshots
- Web-based agent management and control
- Real-time status monitoring
- Add/remove agents dynamically

## AI Assistant (NEW) ü§ñ

Natural language control of your agents using local AI:

```powershell
# Install AI dependencies (includes Ollama)
.\install_ai.bat

# Use standalone AI assistant
python ai_assistant.py

# Or use integrated with web orchestrator
python orchestrator_web.py
# Then use the AI chat in the web interface
```

**AI Command Examples:**
- "Take a screenshot of all agents"
- "Click at position 100, 200 on the main agent" 
- "Type hello world in the text field"
- "Show me the status of all agents"
- "Scroll down on agent 1"

**Features:**
- üß† Local AI (no cloud required) using Ollama
- üéØ Natural language command parsing
- ü§ñ Multi-agent coordination
- üí¨ Conversational interface in web UI
- üìù Command history and context awareness
- üîí Safety checks for low-confidence commands

API endpoints

- GET /status ‚Äî health and basic info
- GET /screenshot ‚Äî base64-encoded JPEG (returns `no_change` when unchanged)
- GET /stream ‚Äî MJPEG stream (~10 FPS)
- POST /exec ‚Äî execute actions (requires token)
